CHAPTER 1
THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND

Background of the Study 
	Different forms of learning have been discovered to suit the different needs of students. Different schools use different methods. Having the type of learning can help the student understand better and enjoy the learning experience more. Individually, students have different ways on how they are able to focus and study better. An effective study habit would contribute to a student’s academic competence. It greatly affects a student’s preference of learning. Some students prefer to study using technology and some prefer to study by just reading their books and listening to their teachers face to face.
	Technology nowadays is an addictive thing that many people are being attached to. There are many forms of technology in this world; cellphones, laptops, computers, etc. 
	There are three types of learning approach to be considered: traditional and digital and blended. Traditional learning or studying is a type of learning that the students are talking or listening in front of the teachers and using books as the reference. It is a type of learning that most people use. Digital learning is a type of learning that uses any type of gadgets as the reference. Also, the students can use technology on answering quizzes, taking exams etc. There is also a mix of both which is called blended learning. Blended learning is a type of learning that the traditional and technological learning are combined. It is when the students are studying through student-teacher interaction and using technology at the same time. 
	Providing the best possible learning for the students is the goal of every school. 
In this research, the researchers aim to determine the students’ preferred learning approach based on their study habits. 

Statement of the Problem
The research aims to identify the preferred learning approach based on the study habits among Junior High School students. The researchers seek to answer the following questions:
1.	What are the most practiced study habits among the Junior High School students?
2.	What is the preferred learning approach among the Junior High School students?

Scope and Delimitation
	This study focuses on the preferred learning approach among Junior High School Students based on their study habits. This research will be conducted in Lyceum of the Philippines University Cavite, School Year 2019-2020. Primary data will come from the students of this institution. It will focus on their preferred learning approach and most practiced study habits. The study will be done through utilization of questionnaire to the students as a survey and reference. This study is only limited to grades 7 to 10 of Lyceum of the Philippines University Cavite. This will not cover other problems that does not concern their preferred learning approach and most practiced study habits. By this procedure, the researchers will be able to determine the preferred learning approach based on the study habits of the students.

Significance of the Study

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF THE RELATED LITERATURE
	In this chapter, the researchers present the conceptual literature and related studies. It includes the collection of finished thesis, books, articles and online sources that would help in analyzing the details that are relevant to the present study. ”Preferred Learning Approach based on the Study Habits among Junior High School students of Lyceum of the Philippines University Cavite-International School.”

Education
	Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits (Wikipedia). It is a process that happens anywhere, not just in school. Currently, distance education is the fastest developing form of domestic and international education (Gunawardena & McIsaac, 2013). It is said that students strongly prefer distance education, largely because it allows them to balance their other commitments more easily (Hannay & Newvine, 2006). An example of this would be e-learning or online learning. It is a form of learning with the use of technology. It does not require students to be in a traditional classroom. With the rise of e-learning, it gave way for Blended Learning. There was a study conducted to compare learning outcomes from both online and blended learning. Once done, results indicated there was a significant difference in instructional and learner factors but there was none in learning outcomes (Kupritz, Lim & Morris, 2007)

Study Habits
	Study habits contribute significantly in the development of knowledge and perceptual capacities. Study habits tell a person that how much he will learn and how far he wants to go, and how much he wants to earn (Rabia,et al.,2017). Based on a sample of business students, results showed some study habits had a positive direct relationship on student performance, but others had a negative direct relationship (Nonis & Hudson, 2010). Study habits is how one studies. That is, the habits which students form during their school years. Without good study habits, a student cannot succeed. (Ebele & Olofu, 2017).

Kinds of Study Habits
	Develop a Study Plan. First things first: students need to know when a test will take place, the types of questions that will be included and the topics that will be covered. From there, your student should create a study plan and allow ample time to prepare – there’s nothing worse than cramming the night before an exam. You can help by buying a wall calendar and asking him or her to assign topics and tasks for each day leading up to a due date or exam. Setting goals for each session is also key to success. If your child needs some help developing a study plan, our study skills program a great resource Our tutors will work with your child to develop an individualized plan that fits his or her needs, while instilling effective time management tips and organizational skills.
	Keeping a formal schedule. Before the beginning of term, draw up a one-week spreadsheet and block out all your known commitments – work shifts, family time, sleep – as applicable. Factor in transit time. Duplicate the spreadsheet and plan out your term around these existing commitments, bearing in mind the personal deadlines you’ve defined. Be realistic: if you work best studying in short bursts, don’t place all of your study time into a single day-long block. Remember too that even during commitments you might have downtime – lunchtimes at work are a great time to catch up on your reading list. Where possible, you may want to try scheduling learning on the same day and time every week to retain the structure of an offline course.
	Highlighting is a visual indication that text or another object is selected with the mouse or keyboard. When text, files, folders, cells, or other objects are highlighted, they'll be a different color, have a bold border, or other types of formatting that differentiate it from other objects. For example, when highlighting text, the selected text colors reverse, show as blue, have dots around the selection, or have bold lines around the selected text.
Highlighting text allows a user to move, copy, or cut that selected text. Highlighting an object, such as an icon, also allows it to be cut, copied, deleted, moved, viewed, opened, or otherwise manipulated.

Learning Approach
	Learning strategies are also linked to, and influenced by, the learning style. The concept of learning style has diverse definitions that reflect the complexities pertaining to the investigation of the learning process (Swanson, 1995) (As cited in Learning Approach and Learning: Exploring a New Technological Learning System, pg 2). We don’t just learn knowledge and facts - we also learn skills and attitudes (Prozesky, n.d.). Identifying the students' learning style will offer greater comprehension for teachers who initiate classroom teaching and learning practices. The nature of the lessons should be suitable for the relational aspects of how best to learn the expertise and skills expected for students (Velasco et al., 2015). This supported the essence of the learning approach, based on their respective composite mean, has a greater influence than the physical variables when it comes to understanding the respondent (Abante, Almendral, Manansala, Mañibo, 2014).

Traditional Learning
	They preferred face-to-face learning for communication purposes in which a shared understanding must be derived or in which interpersonal relations are to be established (Paechter & Maier, 2010). Among the two course of face-to-face approach there is a slight difference between to the several measures of learning outcome. Students prefer face to face learning due to communication purposes which helps the student and teacher to understand each other in a more personal level. A study examined the performance of Master’s‐level students in an online course in Cognition, Learning and Assessment and compared it with the performance of students in a face‐to‐face classroom setting of the same course. Data were collected from six sections of the course over a two‐year period. The same professor taught all sections. Identical final exams plus two common assignments were used to determine whether there were differences in performance. An analysis of covariance, with graduate record exam scores as the covariate, was applied using each of the dependent variables. Students in the face‐to‐face class scored significantly higher on two out of the three measures. (Ferguson & Tryjankowski, 2009). With identical exams and two common assignments, students in the face to face class scored higher in two out of the three.

Digital learning
	They are developing their own skills while making students comfortable with the technology that will help them be successful (Granberg, 2000). More than half of the students makes use of the technologies to facilitate learning (Mbah, 2010) and was supported by a previous research by Bataineh and Baniabdelrahman (2005) “who pointed out that computers can be used as a supplement but cannot fully replace the teacher’s job. Thus students use computers to download and save relevant information from the internet so as to facilitate learning,” (as cited in Mbah, 2010) And in this modern age, Ditmyer et al. (2011) said that almost all of the students who were examined, reported spending more than 11 hours per week studying. Additionally, the respondents said they spend less time using their textbooks to study.

Synthesis
	A learner's characteristics/background, study habits, design features and learning outcomes are some of the factors of a student’s effective learning style. Study habits are learning strategies which maximizes the learning process and is associated to the learning style of the student. 
	Digital learning is an example of learning style that does not require students to be in a traditional class set-up, it uses technology which supports the students to improve their own skills. Online learning has a flexible time management and environment. Face-to-face learning builds close association through communication. Traditional classroom students have adaptability when it comes to their classes which follows a schedule that requires someone to be on a certain time and place. Blended learning is combined traditional and online learning which allows students to set their own pace when it comes to their studies.





CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
	In this chapter, the researchers present the research design, instruments, context and participants, data gathering procedure, and data analysis. 

Research Design
	This study utilizes descriptive quantitative method to assess the preferred learning approach based on the study habits of the Junior High school students of Lyceum of the Philippines University, Cavite. Quantitative methods emphasize objective measurements and the statistical, mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys, or by manipulating pre-existing statistical data using computational techniques. Quantitative research focuses on gathering numerical data and generalizing it across groups of people or to explain a particular phenomenon (Babbie, 2010). The researchers applied descriptive study method to know the preferred learning approach of the Junior High school students of Lyceum of the Philippines Cavite with thorough analysis without intervention.

Instruments
	The researchers used self-made likert scale and modified checklist type of questionnaires to conduct the survey and to gather a quantitative information which will be answered by Grades 7 to 10 Junior High school students to determine their preferred learning approach based on their study habits. The researchers applied likert scale, a rating system used in questionnaires that is designed to measure people’s attitudes, opinions, or perceptions (Jamieson, 2013). An effective likert scale include a series of questions that you ask people to answer, and ideally 5-7 balanced responses people can choose from. It often comes with a neutral midpoint (Lieke, 2020). The researchers use a checklist type of modified-close ended questionnaires. Checklist questions are defined as question types that ask respondents to choose from a distinct set of pre-defined responses, such as “yes/no” or among a set multiple choice questions. In a typical scenario, checklist questions are used to gather quantitative data from respondents.

Context and Participants
	The researchers used self-made likert scale and modified checklist type of questionnaires in conducting the survey. To identify the study habits of the respondents, the researchers used checklist type of questionnaires. The likert scale type of questionnaire on the other hand, is used to determine the preferred learning approach of the respondents. The researchers used two types of sampling techniques to gather data from the respondents among the Junior High school students of Lyceum of the Philippines University-Cavite (LPU-C). The first sampling technique is simple random sampling. It is applied to gather data from the total number of categorized-based respondents. The other sampling technique that the researchers used is quota sampling. The researchers aim to have a quota of 50 respondents that will come from the Junior High School Department. It is to consider the junior high school students as they will be participating in every research that is being conducted. LPU-C is the first resort campus in the Philippines that promotes various departments from high school to college and where the study is conducted on the 14th of August 2019 up until the end of May 2020. The participants, both male and female, are of ages 12 to 18 and will come from the Junior High school department.
Data Gathering Procedure
In the process of collecting data for our study, the researchers used the following methods: the researchers first discussed about Chapter 3 and the methods to use and searched for questionnaires related to their study. The researchers prepared a draft of their 30-item questionnaire which was used to evaluate the preferred learning approach based on the study habits of the Junior High School students of LPU-Cavite. The questionnaire is then passed through the research adviser for further corrections and to the Headmaster for approval of conduction. Once approved, the questionnaire will then be answered by all the grade levels in Junior High School. The respondents will be chosen through Simple Random Sampling. There will be 8 respondents per section which all-in-all will be 50 respondents. After the questionnaire is answered by the respondents, the data will then be analyzed to evaluate the preferred learning approach based on the study habit of the students.
Data Analysis
	The gathered data were processed by the quantitative research method called the likert scale and checklist. The researchers also applied the formula of percentage, weighted mean, frequency distribution table and chart to analyze the gathered data. 
1.	Demographic Profile
	The demographic profile consists of name (optional), age, grade level of the respondents. It is used to organize the respondents by their age and grade level to answer the research questions of the proponents.
2.	Nominal Scale
	Nominal scale was used when the study that is being conducted has only two options with no numerical value. Nominal scale is a measurement scale, in which numbers serve as “tags” or “labels” only, to identify or classify an object. (Bhat, n.d.) As the survey has no numerical value, this was the proponents used as a scale.
3.	Likert Scale
	Likert scale was used in this study as a rating scale to measure attitudes, values and opinions. With this scale, respondents were asked to rate items on a level of agreement. The researchers used likert scale to determine the preferred learning approach of the students.
	Table 1. Rating Scale and Verbal Interpretation for Scoring and Identifying the Learning Approach Preference of the participants.
Rating Scale
(Likert)	Verbal Interpretation
1	Never. The respondent does not learn from this kind of learning approach.
2	Rarely. The respondent seldom learns from this kind of learning approach.
3	Sometimes. The respondent occasionally learns from this kind of learning approach.
4	Often. The respondent frequently learns from this kind of learning approach.
5	Always. The respondent always learns from this kind of learning approach.

4.	Percentage
	It is the rate of a number to population and is denoted by a percent symbol (%). The percentage of each was calculated by dividing the frequency to the number of participants who answered the survey then multiplying it to 100. The formula applied to this technique was: 
%=(f/n) x 100
Where:
%=percentage
f=frequency
n=number of total sample/participants
5.	Weighted Mean
	It was used to determine the average responses of the different questions provided in the questionnaire used. The weighted arithmetic mean equals the sum of observations multiplied by their weights divided by the sum of their weights. The formula used was:
X=∑ fx / n
Where:
X=weighted mean
∑ fx = sum of all the products of f and x; f being the frequency and x as the weight of each operation
n= number of total sample/participants
6.	Frequency Distribution Table
	It is a tabular representation of a survey data set used to organize and summarize the data. The researchers used this to interpret the gathered data.
7.	Bar graph
	Bar graph is a chart that uses the height of a rectangle. It shows comparisons among categories. The researchers used this to represent the demographic profile of the respondents.
8.	Tables
It is a visual representation that organize the data used and show the patterns or relationship of the data.
